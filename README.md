# 📚 Vault of Concepts

Welcome to my personal **Vault of Concepts** — a structured and evolving repository of all the core programming concepts, techniques, and lessons I've learned over time.

This repo serves as:

- ✅ A quick reference guide for myself
- 🧠 A place to reinforce deep understanding of complex ideas
- 🚀 A growing knowledge base as I explore topics like TypeScript, Playwright, testing, OOP, and more

> Think of this as my personal dev wiki — built by me, for me (and maybe you too 😉).

### 📚 Topics I'm Exploring on My Journey to Becoming a Test Automation Engineer

Here’s a curated list of key areas I’m learning, practicing, and refining as I build toward expertise in test automation:

- 🧠 **TypeScript** — Core fundamentals, advanced typing, and OOP patterns  
- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — Design principles and real-world use  
- 🧪 **Playwright** — End-to-end testing strategies, fixtures, and custom patterns  
- 🔧 **Jenkins** — CI/CD pipelines, build automation, and advanced workflows  
- 🌐 **API Testing** — Manual & automated testing with REST clients and tools  
- ✍️ **BDD with Cucumber** — Writing human-readable tests with step definitions  
- ⚙️ **JMeter** — Performance and load testing essentials  
- 🗂️ **Git & Version Control** — Branching, rebasing, and collaboration workflows  
- 🚀 _...and more as the learning continues!_
